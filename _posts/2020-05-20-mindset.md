I recently stumbled upon these wise words from Doc Norton from OnBelay.

I love this because it cuts right to the heart of what matters most in software development. I've seen too many teams get caught up in the mechanics of their chosen frameworks, rather than focusing on what really matters.

> Work together.  
Create simple things in small steps.  
Be meticulous about composition.
Validate before, during, and after.  
Know the problem you are solving.  
Release ridiculously often.  
Automation over documentation.
