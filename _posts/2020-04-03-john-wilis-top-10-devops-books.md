# John Willis knows DevOps...

In the last couple years, I've read a lot of books on Lean, Agile, Product, Business, DevOps, Analytics, Training.

I only recently discovered how brilliant John Willis is after listening to the audiobook of Beyond The Phoenix Project - The Origins and Evolution of DevOps by John Willis and Gene Kim...

The depth of knowledge that John has is actually a little bit scary or inspiring...

Today I stumbled upon a Medium article where he listed out his own Top Ten DevOps books and so I thought I'd add them here for future reference.

### The Top 10:

1. The Phoenix Project: A Novel about IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business Win
2. Effective DevOps: Building a Culture of Collaboration, Affinity, and Tooling at Scale
3. Accelerate: The Science of Lean Software and DevOps: Building and Scaling High Performing Technology Organizations
4. Continuous Delivery: Reliable Software Releases through Build, Test, and Deployment Automation
5. Practice of Cloud System Administration, The: Designing and Operating Large Distributed Systems, Volume 2
6. Liquid Software: How to Achieve Trusted Continuous Updates in the DevOps World
7. Leading the Transformation: Applying Agile and DevOps Principles at Scale
8. The Unicorn Project: A Novel about Developers, Digital Disruption, and Thriving in the Age of Data
9. Making Work Visible: Exposing Time Theft to Optimize Work & Flow
