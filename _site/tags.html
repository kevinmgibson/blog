    "body": "2020/07/04 - We need to stop using estimation as a legitimate approach to planning. Unless you work in an ultra stable environment in which very little ever changes, then using estimation to plan a complex initiative will only hurt, not help. Why? Because the estimates are based on a point in time at which you know the very least and the estimate aka “prediction” is almost sure to be wrong. In some cases, very wrong. Not to mention that the backlog will almost certainly change several times making all the estimation pointless. Estimates also have a funny way of rather conveniently being nipped and tucked to align with quarterly business plans and budgets rather than aligning to actual reality. And all those massive assumptions, risks and dependencies are noted and shoved down into the appendix of the proposal doc. The original estimates are further diluted to lower cost and reduce timeline and then, bickety bam, the projects are locked and loaded, and those unrealistic estimates becomes the official plan. Ooof! What happens next is a vicious and harmful cycle in which expectation collides violently with reality. If you stand back and look at the big picture, you’ll see that customer retention, net promoter score, brand sentiment, profitability, cash flow, employee engagement and employee attraction and retention will all take successive hits. If this all sounds like a Dilbert cartoon, well…   How the Hell Did We Get Here? Part of the problem, and I’m specifically speaking about IT and Software Development initiatives is that most organizations view IT initiatives as an expense and therefore, it is to be tightly controlled via scope, budget, date. «««&lt; HEADModern organizations don’t look at it this way… At modern organizations, a Software Development initiative is an investment.

    "title": "How to Write Great Objectives & Key Results",
    "body": "2020/06/26 - Writing great OKRs takes time, patience and practice… Here’s a list of important “Do’s and Don’ts” when getting started… Definitely Do:Start with Values, Vision &amp; Mission — Before writing any OKRs, make sure your leadership team agree on the organizational Values, Vision and Mission. OKRs are a great way to distill the organizational Values, Vision &amp; Mission into real actionable goals with measurable results. Focus on Core Business Drivers — Write OKRs that focus on improving the core business drivers like Reducing Lead Time on Customer Requests, Employee Attraction and Retention etc. Work Top Down — OKRs work really well for turning big strategic organizational goals into reality… Skip the small fry tactical stuff, and think big. Think Big, Deliver in Short Cycles — Turning game changing ideas into measurable goals takes time. Write annual OKRs to capture and frame the big picture. Write quarterly OKRs to capture and deliver “slices” of the annual OKRs so that you can deliver value early and often. Get Cross-Functional — Thinking big means that every department is going to need to come together as a unit to deliver the big goal. OKR is a great way to get leaders away from locally optimizing their own departments and thinking as a “team of teams”. Balance Capacity — OKRs are useless if your leadership has no capacity to deliver them. It’s important to evaluate your operational capacity and find the right balance. Defund anything that doesn’t align with your strategic OKRs. Definitely Don’t:Use Meaningless Buzzwords — Ditch the buzzwords. Keep the language simple. Every level of the organization should be able to understand what you’re trying to accomplish and how you’ll measure success. Use Biz Babble — ”We’re going to find synergies and exploit emerging opportunities in the marketplace” — Nope, nope, nope - go sit in the corner with Mr. Buzzwords over there. Write OKR To-Do Lists — OKR is NOT a means for leadership to draft the master to-do list for their teams. Full Stop. Do not do this. Use OKR as an Evaluation Tool: — Measure employee performance based on how your people behave and collaborate, not by how many OKRs they got done this quarter. OKRs for EVERYBODY!!! — If you’re giving OKRs to your interns, you’re doing it wrong! "

Be meticulous about composition. Validate before, during, and after. Know the problem you are solving. Release ridiculously often. Automation over documentation.
