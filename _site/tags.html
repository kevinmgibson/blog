    "body": "2020/07/04 - We need to stop believing that estimates are a reliable input to the initiative planning process. Instead, we should plan and prioritize initiatives based on value. Am I saying that estimates have no place in the planning process? No, I’m not saying that. Estimation does have it’s place, when properly applied. While estimation may work in low complexity, stable environments, it is generally not a reliable approach and usually causes more harm than good. Consider Healthcare. gov, originally estimated to cost $95 million dollars… Actual cost was $1. 7 billion or roughly 17 times the original estimate. . Of course, cost overruns of that magnitude are not entirely attributed to poor estimation, many other factors were at play in that debacle. That said, in all walks of life, there are volumes of examples to prove that estimation is an unreliable tool that should be applied carefully. Why are we so bad at estimating? Humans are hard wired to drastically underestimate the actual time, cost and risk required to complete tasks, projects, initiatives etc. Even when past experience tells us that it will take longer, our brains short circuit and default to a “best case scenario” mental model, and we tell ourselves, “this time will be different. ” This is known as “Planning Fallacy”, a concept first introduced by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky way back in 1979. Basically, planning fallacy happens when we try to estimate anything complex, we naturally apply our own personal bias, and skew our ability to be objective and estimate accurately. Agile to the rescue! Using iterative and incremental software development practices i. e. “Agile” recognizes that by planning work in short cycles it becomes easier to estimate by referencing previous examples, patterns and results. But here’s the rub… When estimation is used upfront, at a point in time in which the absolute least is known, and the estimate is considered reliable enough to serve as the basis for creating the release plan, budget, resourcing, and scope, then the delivery teams, whether Agile or not, are already trapped and potentially doomed to fail. In this scenario, delivery teams are victims of a vicious cycle where expectation violently collides with reality. And this is a truly really harmful and prevalent practice which ultimately affects customer perception, team engagement, employee attraction and referrals, and overall business performance. So, are you saying to never use estimation? Going back to the start of this post, I’m not saying that estimates aren’t useful, there is a place for them, and I’m writing a follow up post to unpack how we can use estimates as an input to the overall planning process. What we must acknowledge is that estimations are largely influenced by personal bias and so we must use them carefully to avoid causing undue harm. I’ll write a follow up post shortly to unpack alternative approaches to planning using a value based approach. "

    "title": "How to Write Great OKRs",
    "body": "2020/06/26 - Writing great OKRs takes time, patience and practice… Here’s a list of important “Do’s and Don’ts” when getting started… Definitely Do:Start with Values, Vision &amp; Mission — Before writing any OKRs, make sure your leadership team agree on the organizational Values, Vision and Mission. OKRs are a great way to distill the organizational Values, Vision &amp; Mission into real actionable goals with measurable results. Focus on Core Business Drivers — Write OKRs that focus on improving the core business drivers like Reducing Lead Time on Customer Requests, Employee Attraction and Retention etc. Work Top Down — OKRs work really well for turning big strategic organizational goals into reality… Skip the small fry tactical stuff, and think big. Think Big, Deliver in Short Cycles — Turning game changing ideas into measurable goals takes time. Write annual OKRs to capture and frame the big picture. Write quarterly OKRs to capture and deliver “slices” of the annual OKRs so that you can deliver value early and often. Get Cross-Functional — Thinking big means that every department is going to need to come together as a unit to deliver the big goal. OKR is a great way to get leaders away from locally optimizing their own departments and thinking as a “team of teams”. Balance Capacity — OKRs are useless if your leadership has no capacity to deliver them. It’s important to evaluate your operational capacity and find the right balance. Defund anything that doesn’t align with your strategic OKRs. Definitely Don’t:Use Meaningless Buzzwords — Ditch the buzzwords. Keep the language simple. Every level of the organization should be able to understand what you’re trying to accomplish and how you’ll measure success. Use Biz Babble — ”We’re going to find synergies and exploit emerging opportunities in the marketplace” — Nope, nope, nope - go sit in the corner with Mr. Buzzwords over there. Write OKR To-Do Lists — OKR is NOT a means for leadership to draft the master to-do list for their teams. Full Stop. Do not do this. Use OKR as an Evaluation Tool: — Measure employee performance based on how your people behave and collaborate, not by how many OKRs they got done this quarter. OKRs for EVERYBODY!!! — If you’re giving OKRs to your interns, you’re doing it wrong! "
